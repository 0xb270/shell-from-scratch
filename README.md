# shell-from-scratch
Build a small and simple shell from scratch to learn UNIX/LINUX system programming.

### Why?
* I use Linux and bash/zsh every day.
* But I don't know exactly how it works.
* I want to learn Linux system programming by building a small and simple shell from scratch.

### Background knowledge
* Introduction to Shell
